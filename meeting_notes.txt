16:08:45 Maria Chen: Quick question - what's your typical uptime SLA?

16:08:52 Sarah Johnson: We guarantee 99.99% uptime with our enterprise tier, backed by our comprehensive SLA.

16:09:30 Sarah Johnson: The enterprise package that would suit your needs is priced at $45K annually, which includes 24/7 support and all premium features.

[Several minutes of technical discussion...]

16:30:45 Sarah Johnson: To summarize: I'll send over the full proposal including pricing, SLAs, and migration support by end of day. Would you like to schedule a technical deep-dive next week?
